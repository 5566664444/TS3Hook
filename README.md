## What is this?

This is a hook that decrypts Teamspeak 3 command packets on the fly and displays them in Teamspeak's own Console.

## How to use

1. Download and install the [latest release](https://github.com/ReSpeak/TS3Hook/releases/latest) for your client's architecture.
2. Add `-console` to the startup parameters of your TS3Client shortcut. ([Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/a5HgomX.png))
3. Start `Injector.exe` as admin.
4. (If asked enter the ID of the running client.)
5. Take a look at the console named `Teamspeak 3 Client`.
6. Profit

## Todo

- Move the whole project to a TS3 Plugin so it gets auto-injected on client start.
- Make it possible to inject (send) own commands.
